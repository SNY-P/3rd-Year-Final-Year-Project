# Year 3: Final Year Project - Mobile Application Focusing on Understanding of Maths Relations

This repo will contain the code, and report of my final year project that was undertaken by me in my 3rd year of university.

## About the Project
The project that was developed was a mobile application created on Android to aid student and others that are struggling with the topic of Maths Relations. There were 4 types of questions that were implemented for the applications: cartesian product and the relations of symmetric, reflexive & transitive. However, after submission and during the demo, I was told that I have misinterpreted the meaning of the equations of each relation type.

Therefore, in the future, I am hoping the fix the issue and improve upon my work.
